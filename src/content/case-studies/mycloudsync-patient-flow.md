## Project Overview

MyCloudSync needed a real-time patient flow system that gives clinics clarity without cognitive overload. We designed role-specific dashboards so each team member sees only the next actions they’re responsible for, while system state changes automatically generate timing data for leadership metrics.

## The Challenge

Clinics often rely on one busy screen that everyone watches, which creates confusion, missed handoffs, and stalled flow. The goal was to preserve visibility without overwhelming staff, ensure patient states match real clinical flow, and keep PHI off shared or wall-mounted displays.

## Our Solution

We implemented a multi-view system with clear state transitions and permissions per role:

- **Front Desk View**: Primary workspace with patient demographics for EMR updates, active-state indicators (green/yellow/red), and controlled transitions (Checked In → Front Desk In Progress → Ready for Back). Includes the ability to complete visits at checkout and recover from accidental state changes with confirmation.
- **Nurse / Clinical Staff View**: Focused queue showing only patients ready for intake, with limited actions (Start Intake → Ready for Provider) and no front-desk-only controls.
- **Provider View**: Minimal, provider-only queue (Begin Visit → Ready for Checkout) to reduce cognitive load to “who is ready for me.”
- **Metrics / Admin Dashboard**: Aggregated performance insights such as average front desk time, clinical wait time, provider wait time, and total visit time, enabling leadership to spot bottlenecks without micromanagement.

## Outcome

The result is a clean, role-specific flow system that makes clinic throughput obvious at a glance. Automated timing data improves operational insights, while focused views reduce errors and keep teams moving efficiently through each visit.
