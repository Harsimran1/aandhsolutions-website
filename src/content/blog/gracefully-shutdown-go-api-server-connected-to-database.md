Go offers scalable and robust mechanism for creating API servers. As most of APIs talk to some database, on a scaled infrastructure receiving a lot of requests per second, it is important to shutdown gracefully in order to prevent goroutine leaks. This means closing two things in our case.

HTTP Server and DB connection.

Go `net/http` package offers `Shutdown` function to gracefully shutdown your http server. [https://godoc.org/net/http#Server.Shutdown](https://godoc.org/net/http#Server.Shutdown).

Go `database/sql` package offers `Close` function to gracefully close the connection to sql. [https://godoc.org/database/sql#DB.Close](https://godoc.org/database/sql#DB.Close)

#### 1) Create a minimal HTTP API service using a Database.#### 2) Change your server function “srv.ListenAndServe()” to run in a goroutine.go func() {
    panic(srv.ListenAndServe())
}()This is done to ensure that `main` will not exit when `srv.ListenAndServe() `returns on stop signal and waits for database to be closed. Note that we’re using `panic` rather than `log.Fatal `to capture errors from `srv.ListenAndServe()` in order to be able to call defer in next steps.

#### 3) Create a channel to receive stop signals.stop := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
signal.Notify(stop, os.Interrupt)
signal.Notify(stop, syscall.SIGTERM)Bonus point: If you’re using kubernetes, note that it sends `SIGTERM` signal to its pods for shutting down. `Interrupt` is normally sent

#### 4) Listen to the stop signals and handle the shutdown of your HTTP Server. You can use defer to close your db connection.`&lt;-stop`Note that we are shutting down HTTP server before closing db because server will need database to handle its API requests.
