## Project Overview

Collaborated with the Smart4Health EU initiative to develop a patient-centric health data platform with end-to-end encryption at its core. The application enables individuals to securely store their personal health records, ensuring that data remains encrypted even on the server side—accessible only by the patient. A secure handshake mechanism was implemented to allow patients to selectively share their data with healthcare providers, putting full control in the hands of the individual. This solution prioritizes privacy, interoperability, and trust in digital healthcare, aligning with EU standards for data protection and patient empowerment.

## The Challenge

Health data is highly sensitive and regulated. The platform needed to:

- Keep patient records encrypted end-to-end, including on the server side
- Enable secure, consent-based sharing with healthcare providers
- Support interoperability standards across EU healthcare systems
- Maintain a simple, trustworthy user experience for patients
- Preserve auditability and compliance without exposing PHI

## Our Solution

We delivered a privacy-first architecture and experience designed for long-term trust:

- End-to-end encryption of personal health records with patient-controlled access
- A secure handshake flow to grant and revoke provider access
- Structured data storage aligned with interoperability requirements
- A patient-centric UX that keeps sharing decisions transparent
- A scalable foundation to support future integrations and new data types

## Outcome

The result is a secure, patient-controlled data platform that aligns with EU standards for privacy and interoperability. Patients gain confidence that their records stay private, while providers can access the exact data they need through explicit consent. The system establishes a trusted foundation for future digital health services and cross-border collaboration.
