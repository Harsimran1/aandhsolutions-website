## Project Overview

Propcan is a Canadian real estate insights platform designed to make property data more transparent and accessible. The platform aggregates property values, historical sale data, and neighborhood-level trends, allowing users to explore and compare real estate with confidence.

Built as a consumer-first product, Propcan focuses on clarity, speed, and trust—removing friction from how buyers, homeowners, and real estate professionals understand the market.

## The Challenge

The Canadian real estate landscape is fragmented, with critical data often locked behind paywalls or difficult-to-navigate tools. The challenge was to:

- Present complex real estate data in a way that is easy to understand
- Support map-based discovery without compromising performance
- Design a scalable system capable of handling large datasets and future feature expansion
- Maintain trust and accuracy in a data-sensitive domain

At the same time, the platform needed to feel fast, modern, and approachable for everyday users—not just industry professionals.

## Our Solution

We designed and built Propcan as a modern, full-stack web application with a strong emphasis on usability and long-term maintainability.

Key aspects of the solution included:

- Clean, intuitive UI focused on property comparison and exploration
- Map-driven search experience to surface insights geographically
- Normalized data models to support historical pricing, trends, and future analytics
- High-performance backend APIs optimized for read-heavy workloads
- Scalable architecture that allows new regions, datasets, and features to be added incrementally

The platform was built using a modern JavaScript stack, enabling rapid iteration while maintaining production-grade reliability.

## Outcome

Propcan launched as a free, data-rich real estate platform that delivers meaningful insights without overwhelming users. The final system:

- Improved accessibility to real estate market data
- Enabled faster and more informed property comparisons
- Established a strong technical foundation for future monetization and feature growth
- Positioned the product as a credible proptech platform in the Canadian market

The architecture and design decisions ensure Propcan can evolve alongside changing market needs, regulatory considerations, and data availability.
