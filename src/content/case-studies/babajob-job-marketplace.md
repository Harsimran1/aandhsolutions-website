## Project Overview

Contributed to the development of a job marketplace platform focused on connecting employers with blue-collar workers across India. The portal streamlined the hiring process by enabling jobseekers to create profiles and apply for roles, while employers could search, shortlist, and contact candidates. Revenue was generated through resume unblocks and interview scheduling, making the platform both accessible and monetizable. Babajob played a key role in bridging the gap in the informal job sector before being acquired by Quikr Jobs.

## The Challenge

The blue-collar job market is fragmented and often underserved by digital tools. The platform needed to:

- Make it easy for jobseekers to create profiles and apply quickly
- Give employers fast search, shortlist, and outreach workflows
- Support monetization without blocking access for workers
- Handle high volumes of low-bandwidth, mobile-first usage
- Build trust in a sector where formal hiring tools were limited

## Our Solution

We helped build a focused marketplace experience that balanced accessibility with employer needs:

- Simple jobseeker onboarding and profile creation
- Employer search tools with filters, shortlists, and contact flows
- Monetization through resume unlocks and interview scheduling
- Scalable platform foundations to support growth across cities

## Outcome

Babajob enabled faster hiring, better visibility for jobseekers, and a sustainable revenue model. The platform became a significant player in the informal job sector and was ultimately acquired by Quikr Jobs, validating the marketplace approach and its impact.
