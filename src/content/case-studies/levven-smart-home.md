## Project Overview

Development and ongoing maintenance of the mobile app and cloud infrastructure for Levven Electronics’ smart home ecosystem. The platform allows users to control every connected outlet—ranging from light fixtures and fans to entertainment devices—directly through a user-friendly mobile application. Integrated with Google Home and Amazon Alexa, the system supports seamless voice-activated control, enhancing convenience and accessibility. The solution combines reliable cloud services with intuitive interfaces to deliver a responsive, scalable, and future-ready smart home experience.

## The Challenge

Smart home experiences break down when device control is slow, unreliable, or inconsistent across platforms. The system needed to:

- Provide real-time control across a wide range of connected outlets
- Keep mobile and voice-assistant experiences synchronized
- Maintain high availability with dependable cloud services
- Support continuous updates as new devices and features were introduced
- Deliver a clean, intuitive UI for everyday household use

## Our Solution

We delivered a reliable app + cloud stack that emphasizes speed and usability:

- A responsive mobile interface for quick access to devices and scenes
- Cloud services optimized for low-latency device control
- Voice assistant integrations with Google Home and Amazon Alexa
- Ongoing maintenance to ensure stability as hardware and firmware evolved
- Scalable architecture that supports new device types and user growth

## Outcome

The result is a cohesive smart home experience that feels fast, dependable, and easy to use. Users can control every connected outlet with confidence, while Levven benefits from a scalable platform that can grow alongside their product line.
