## Project Overview

Our client, a real estate investment company, needed a comprehensive mobile application to serve small-scale investors who required better tools for managing their real estate portfolios. The app needed to provide real-time portfolio tracking, performance analytics, and fund management capabilities, all wrapped in an intuitive interface designed for non-technical users.

## The Challenge

### Portfolio Management Complexity
- **Fragmented Information**: Investors struggled to get a unified view of their portfolio performance across multiple properties and investments
- **Manual Tracking**: Time-consuming manual processes for tracking fund statuses, returns, and property performance

```javascript
// React Native component structure
const PortfolioApp = {
  Dashboard: "Real-time portfolio overview",
  Analytics: "Performance charts and metrics",
  Transactions: "Fund tracking and history",
  Settings: "User preferences and security"
}
```

**Key Frontend Features:**
