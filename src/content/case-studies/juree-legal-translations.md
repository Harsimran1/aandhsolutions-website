## Project Overview

Juree is an AI-driven platform that translates complex legal documents with precision and speed. Tailored for law firms, courts, and global enterprises, it ensures linguistic accuracy while preserving legal intent across jurisdictions. With support for multiple languages and industry-specific terminology, it streamlines cross-border communication and minimizes risks of misinterpretation. Confidentiality, compliance, and clarity—automated and at scale.

## The Challenge

Legal translation is high-stakes: a single mistranslation can change contractual meaning or introduce compliance risk. The platform needed to:

- Preserve legal intent across jurisdictions and legal systems
- Support specialized terminology and consistent phrasing
- Enable secure collaboration between translators and legal teams
- Provide clear auditability for approvals and revisions
- Scale to large volumes without compromising quality

## Our Solution

We built a translation workflow that balances precision and speed:

- A translation editor optimized for legal review and collaboration
- Structured document workflows with approvals and e-signature support
- Terminology controls to enforce consistency across documents
- Secure handling of sensitive documents with role-based access
- A scalable architecture that supports multi-language expansion

## Outcome

The result is a compliant, reliable platform that helps legal teams move faster without sacrificing accuracy. Juree reduces cross-border friction, improves clarity for stakeholders, and provides confidence that translations preserve legal intent at scale.
