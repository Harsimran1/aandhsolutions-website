## Project Overview

This project involved building a secure, cloud-connected platform to remotely monitor and control water treatment systems across multiple commercial buildings. Leveraging JACE controllers, AWS IoT Core, and MQTT, the system enables real-time communication between on-site equipment and a central dashboard. Developed with React for the frontend and Node.js/TypeScript for the backend, the platform allows administrators to trigger routines, monitor water quality, and automate calculations like bleed rate and volume—all from a single interface. WebSocket connections and JWT-based authentication ensure fast, secure access, while Docker containers support consistent deployment and scalability across locations.

## The Challenge

Remote water treatment monitoring is complex and time-sensitive. The system needed to:

- Maintain real-time visibility into equipment status and water quality
- Provide secure remote control across multiple facilities
- Support automated routines and calculations without manual intervention
- Scale reliably as new buildings and controllers came online
- Ensure low-latency communication between on-site devices and the cloud

## Our Solution

We delivered a robust IoT platform with clear operational workflows:

- A centralized dashboard with live telemetry and system health views
- Automated routines for bleed rate and volume calculations
- Secure device communication via AWS IoT Core and MQTT
- Real-time updates delivered over WebSockets
- JWT-based authentication and Dockerized deployments for consistency

## Outcome

The result is a scalable, secure monitoring system that gives operators instant visibility and control across locations. Aquanomix can now manage water treatment operations remotely, reduce manual checks, and expand to new facilities without re-architecting the platform.
