## Project Overview

Designed and developed a set of APIs to calculate and expose the carbon footprint of individual products and recipes, enabling sustainability-aware consumer choices. Originally part of an online grocery store app that allowed users to shop with visibility into the environmental impact of their purchases, the platform aimed to merge convenience with climate consciousness. While the app was sunset post-launch due to limited product-market fit, the core carbon footprint APIs remain available as a standalone offering for businesses looking to integrate sustainability metrics into their own platforms.

## The Challenge

Sustainability data is complex, inconsistent, and difficult to surface in a way consumers can understand. The platform needed to:

- Calculate footprint values at the product and recipe level
- Provide consistent metrics across diverse product catalogs
- Integrate cleanly into shopping experiences without friction
- Maintain performance at scale for consumer-facing applications
- Support reuse as a standalone API after the app was sunset

## Our Solution

We built a reliable API layer focused on clarity and reusability:

- A normalized data model for footprint calculations across products and recipes
- API endpoints designed for quick integration into storefronts and apps
- Clear metric outputs optimized for consumer-facing UX
- Infrastructure designed to scale as new categories and partners onboarded

## Outcome

The result is a reusable carbon footprint API that allows businesses to embed sustainability insights directly into their products. Even after the original grocery app was sunset, the core APIs remained valuable as a standalone offering, supporting new integrations and sustainability-driven initiatives.
